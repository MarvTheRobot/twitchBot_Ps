## Getting Started

Here be the dragons I have fought while building a bot for my [twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/marvrobot).

This readme is as badly written as the code; YMMV

> _... I got stuck very early on, I got unstuck thanks to the work of [Chrissy LeMaire - potatoqualitee](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/tvbot/)

## Setup

If you are here, I'm going to make an assumption that you are curious how to 
build a twitchbot for your channel... and you want to do it in PowerShell.

I will also assume that you didn't get the hint up the ^ 
and visit/use Chrissie's instead.

1. Have an account on twitch
1. Creat an account on twitch for your bot
   1. Name it as you would your child, not sure you can change it for about 30 days.
1. As the bot, get an oauth token from [twitchapps.com/tmi](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
   1. Save this in the project root in a file called token.txt.... 
   1. Write strongly worded issue in my github about how insecure Marv is...

## Run

dot source the main script, run start bot and fill in the params for your bot.
